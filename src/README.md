NCAA14DepthChart
================

A depth chart program for NCAA Football 14 - side project

This is a project that I have been developing while in school to keep my java skills fresh. It allows the user to add a player to the database by submitting the player's name, rating, position and acedemic year. By clicking on the view depth chart button, you can see the players you have added. You can progress the year and adjust their ratings as they increase and the year will increment.
